# Prediction Demo
This project is looking at the tips dataset. The goal is to predict a waiter's tip. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanjanabasu/tips-dataset/data). It's a very small dataset with 243 entries. It has continuous and categorical(nominal and ordinal) features and it has a continuous label, so it's a regression problem. However, it turns out only one feature is needed for the tip prediction, so let's try to explain the total_bill price instead.
